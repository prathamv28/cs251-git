	\subsection*{3 Idiots}
	    A great movie based on three engineering students who after coming to institue realizes there true potential. This movie by Mr. Perfectionist Amir Khan is truly a whole pack of comedy , romance , emotion . A must watch hindi movie.

	\subsection*{Range de Basanti}

		One of those youth movies which show how our own history affects the way we think, and the way we act. The transition, the speed at which the film moves, and all the sequences fall in place very well without boring the audience for a single minute. You literally watch the film from the edge of your seat, waiting to see what happens next.
